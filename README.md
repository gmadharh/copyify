 # Spotify Song Extractor

A chrome extension to easily copy and paste the song name, album, or artist from a Spotify song web page.

This is because it doesn't allow you to highlight any text with the cursor, so this makes it easy by automatically extracting the details and a button to copy it to the clipboard
